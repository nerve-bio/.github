## Donation
Our open-source tool for reverse vaccinology depends on donations to cover the costs of the servers it relies on, as well as to support ongoing research efforts. Due to its high resource usage, your donations are essential in maintaining the tool's accessibility and ensuring it continues to be a valuable asset in the fight against infectious diseases.

## Donation
Our open source reverse vaccinology tool relies on donations to cover the cost of the servers it relies on and to support ongoing research efforts. Due to its higher resource consumption, your donations are essential to keep the tool accessible and to ensure that it continues to be a valuable tool in the fight against infectious diseases.
